  abstract = {The final goal of all industrial machine learning (ML) projects is to
develop ML products and rapidly bring them into production.
However, it is highly challenging to automate and operationalize
ML products and thus many ML endeavors fail to deliver on their
expectations. The paradigm of Machine Learning Operations
(MLOps) addresses this issue. MLOps includes several aspects,
such as best practices, sets of concepts, and development culture.
However, MLOps is still a vague term and its consequences for
researchers and professionals are ambiguous. To address this gap,
we conduct mixed-method research, including a literature review,
a tool review, and expert interviews. As a result of these
investigations, we provide an aggregated overview of the necessary
principles, components, and roles, as well as the associated
architecture and workflows. Furthermore, we furnish a definition
of MLOps and highlight open challenges in the field. Finally, this
work provides guidance for ML researchers and practitioners who
want to automate and operate their ML products with a designated
set of technologies.},

  abstract  = {Inherent characteristics of machine learning algorithms such as their probabilistic nature, their reliance on large datasets as well as their need for constant retraining pose major challenges to the operationalization of machine learning models in the manufacturing domain. As such systems are known to quickly accumulate technical debt due to system-level interdependencies of code, data and models, clear abstractions, boundaries are mandatory, Therefore, this publication derives a systematic functional decomposition of an MLOps sytem tailored to the manufacturing industry into specific domains and contexts. Moreover, a concerete deploymnet view is provided, and possible future research directions are discussed.},

  title     = {Requirements and Reference Architecture for MLOps: Insights from Industry},
  year      = {2022},
  abstract  = {Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) streamline the lifecycle of machine-learning models in production. In recent years, the topic has picked the interest of practitioners, and consequently, a considerable number of tools and gray literature on architecting MLOps environments has emerged. However, this has created a new problem for organizations: selecting the most appropriate tools and design options for implementing their MLOps environments. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a reference architecture and requirements for MLOps by systematically reviewing 58 industrial gray literature articles. Such reference architecture drawn from the state of practice shall aid organizations in making better design and technology choices when embarking on their MLOps journey while providing a technology-independent baseline for further MLOps research.},
